title: Chisel Hardware Builder - Scala Function
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Scala function can be hardware builder

```scala
val x = RegInit(...)
x := wrap_around(x + amt, max)
```

The ':=' connects rhs output to lhs input,

and '+' is an adder with its operands as adder's inputs.

x, amt and max are all hardware instance,

wrap_around just wraps these to a single module.
